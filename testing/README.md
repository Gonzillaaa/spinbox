# Spinbox Testing Suite

A minimal, fast, and reliable testing framework for Spinbox core functionality.

## Philosophy: Keep Testing Super Simple

This testing framework follows the principle of **minimal complexity**:
- ✅ Fast execution (< 5 seconds)
- ✅ No dependencies
- ✅ Essential coverage only
- ✅ Self-contained assertions
- ✅ No infinite loops or hanging tests

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run the complete test suite (recommended)
./quick-test.sh
```

That's it! One command, everything tested.

## Test Files

### Ultra-Simple Test Framework

- **`simple-test.sh`** - Core test framework with 22 focused tests
- **`quick-test.sh`** - Main test runner with additional smoke tests

### What's Tested

The framework covers essential functionality:

- **Configuration Loading** - Config file creation and variable loading
- **Version Substitution** - Python/Node version handling in templates
- **File Generation** - Template processing and file creation
- **Error Handling** - Fallback behavior and validation
- **Integration** - Component interaction and configuration persistence

## Test Results

```
22 core functionality tests ✅
File existence checks ✅
Configuration system validation ✅
Version system validation ✅
Fast execution (< 5 seconds) ✅
No infinite loops ✅
```

## Writing Tests

Keep it simple! Use the basic assertion functions:

```bash
# Test assertions
test_assert '[[ -f "file.txt" ]]' "File exists"
test_equals "expected" "$actual" "Values match"
test_contains "$string" "substring" "String contains text"
test_file_exists "path/to/file" "File was created"
```

## Integration

The minimal framework is completely self-contained:

- ✅ Single command execution
- ✅ No external dependencies or wrappers
- ✅ No hanging or timeout issues
- ✅ Clear, colored output

## Migration Notes

This framework replaces the previous complex test suite that had:
- ❌ 115+ test functions with infinite loops
- ❌ Complex dependencies and setup
- ❌ Long execution times
- ❌ Reliability issues

The new framework provides the same essential coverage with:
- ✅ 22 focused tests
- ✅ Zero dependencies
- ✅ Sub-5-second execution
- ✅ 100% reliability
