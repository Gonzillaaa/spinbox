## üìä Strategic Decision Log

### Architecture Decisions
**Decision Date**: July 2025  
**Shell vs Other Languages**: Chose shell scripts for zero dependencies and universal compatibility  
**Rationale**: Simplicity and speed over feature richness, aligns with core philosophy

**Decision Date**: July 2025  
**TOML Configuration**: Selected TOML for profiles and dependencies over JSON/YAML  
**Rationale**: Human-readable, simple syntax, good parsing libraries available

### Platform Support Decisions
**Decision Date**: July 2025  
**macOS + Linux Only**: Removed Windows support, focus on WSL2 users  
**Rationale**: Simplify maintenance, better align with target developer audience

### Feature Prioritization Philosophy
**Principle**: Every feature must pass the "simplicity test"  
**Process**: New features evaluated against core philosophy first, implementation complexity second  
**Exception Handling**: Complex features only accepted if they solve critical user pain points

## üîÑ Roadmap Maintenance

**Update Frequency**: Daily tactical updates, weekly strategic reviews  
**Review Schedule**: Monthly milestone assessment, quarterly major planning  
**Community Input**: Regular feedback collection and priority adjustment
