## 📚 Implementation References

### Docker Hub Integration Architecture
**Base Images**: 
- `gonzillaaa/spinbox-python-base:latest` (495MB, Python 3.11 + UV)
- `gonzillaaa/spinbox-node-base:latest` (276MB, Node.js 20 + npm)

**Configuration**: Users can customize via `~/.spinbox/global.conf`:
```bash
DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME="mycompany"
SPINBOX_PYTHON_BASE_IMAGE="mycompany/python-dev"
SPINBOX_NODE_BASE_IMAGE="mycompany/node-dev"
```

**Performance**: 50-70% faster project creation with `--docker-hub` flag
**Architecture Decision**: Base + package manager approach (not pre-built apps)
**Implementation Details**: See PR #26 and `docs/user/docker-hub-configuration.md`

**Future Migration Path**: When ready, create official `spinbox` organization on Docker Hub ($15/month) and transfer images to `spinbox/python-base`, `spinbox/node-base` for professional branding.
