**Description**: Automatically detect and resolve port conflicts when multiple Spinbox projects are running simultaneously.

**Implementation**:
- Smart port detection that scans for in-use ports (8000, 3000, 5432, 6379)
- Auto-increment ports when conflicts detected (8001, 3001, 5433, 6380)
- Save resolved ports to project configuration for consistency
- Update docker-compose.yml with resolved ports

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates "port already in use" errors in multi-project development
- Seamless experience when running multiple prototypes
- No manual port management required

### **Editor Integration Enhancement**
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: Low  
**Description**: Customize DevContainer extensions and settings based on user's preferred editor.

**Implementation**:
- Use `PREFERRED_EDITOR` config to select appropriate extension sets
- VS Code users get VS Code-specific extensions (Pylance, ESLint, etc.)
- Cursor users get Cursor-optimized extensions
- Other editors get minimal, universal extension set
- Allow custom extension lists in user configuration

**Benefits**:
- Personalized development environment out-of-the-box
